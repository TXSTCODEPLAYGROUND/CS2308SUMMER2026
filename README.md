# CS2308: C++ Programming Class Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the CS2308 C++ Programming Class repository. This repository is intended to contain course materials and projects for the CS2308 course.

***Please review GitHub readme sections in Canvas***

## Repository Rules

This repository is **private**. Unauthorized sharing of this repository or any of its contents is strictly prohibited.

## Guidelines for Students

* **No Direct Changes to Main Branch**: Students are not allowed to make any changes directly to the main branch.
* **Pushing Your Work**:
    * You should push all your work to the `contributions/your_username/` folder. Replace `your_username` with your actual github username.
    * If you wish to contribute to the `chapters/unitxx` sections, open PR and seek review before merging to `main`
    * Please follow PR guide-lines below to make reviewable Pull Requests
* **PR Guide Lines for merging to Main Branch**:
    * If you wish to contribute to the main branch, you must first create a new branch.
    * Your branch name should follow this format: `netid_yourname_fixing_lecture001_array`
        * Example: If your netid is `jdoe123`, and name is JDoe and you are fixing the code for lecture 001 on arrays, your branch name should be `jdoe123_jdoe_fixing_lecture001_array`.
        * Comments: Your comments should be meaningful and follow this pattern, `"Jdoe, Lecture001 array code bugs removed"`
    * Once your work is complete, open a pull request for a review.
    * Add Grader (Sandhya Neupane, email: `sandhya@txstate.edu` username: `sandhyaneupane`) as a reviewer.
* **Executing Projects (VS Code or VIA Terminal)**:
    ``` bash
    bash run.sh path\to\your\project
    ```

    or,

    ``` bash
    sh run.sh path\to\your\project
    ```

    or,

    ``` bash
    .\run.sh path\to\your\project
    ```

    e.g., if you want compile and run

    ```
    chapter_codes/unit01/LambdaFunctions
    ```

    you should execute:

    ``` bash
    sh run.sh chapter_codes/unit01/LambdaFunctions
    ```
* **Executing Projects (VS Code or VIA Terminal)**:
  * Open each projects (e.g., `chapter_codes/unit01/LambdaFunctions` as main directory in CLION, select `CMakeLists.txt` -> right click -> Reload CMAke Project)
  * Now you execute the code by clicking Play Button

***NOTE*** You can compile and execute the projects using CLION or VSCode using Run(Play Icon) button Or, you can use terminal to execute `run.sh` commands from root-directory to compile and execute the projects with:

Here's a **basic workflow** for students to contribute code to the GitHub project, broken down into clear steps:

- - -

## Basic Workflow

### 1\. Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository from git-bash or terminal (or, you can use CLION, follow canvas video instructions):**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/TXSTCODEPLAYGROUND/CS2308SUMMER2026.git
```

* This will create a folder named `CS2308SUMMER2026` on your local machine.
    * Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
2. **Navigate into the Project Directory:**

``` bash
cd CS2308SUMMER2026
```

- - -

### 2\. Running Specific Code Examples

There are two ways to run the code examples based on the editor you're using:

**A. Using CLion or VSCode (CLion Recommended for C++ users):**

1. Open **CLion or VSCode** and select **"Open Project"**, then navigate to the cloned project folder.
2. Locate the specific code example (E.g., open `chapters/unit01/LambdaFunctions` as main directory) or program you want to run.
3. Click the **Run** button in **CLion or VSCode** to execute the selected program.
**CLion Run Example**
    1. You can open any projects inside chapters/unitxx/SomeProjectName independently in CLION
    2. Example: chapters/unit01/LambdaFunctions can be open in a new CLION Window
    3. Goto File->Reload Cmake Files or, Select CMAKELists.txt file -> right click -> Reload Cmake Files (Note: Sometimes you should delete cmake-build-debug folder)
    4. Execute the program by running play (execute, green triangle) button

**B. Using Command Line (Alternative Approach):**

1. Open **CS2308SUMMER2026** as root-directory in **Visual Studio Code or CLION, and open the terminal**.
2. Now follow **Executing Projects** guidelines above
3. Use the `run.sh` script to execute the program by running:

``` bash
sh run.sh path/to/project/dir
```

or,

``` bash
bash run.sh path/to/project/dir
```

or,

``` bash
./run.sh path/to/project/dir
```

Ensure the script has execute permissions. If not, grant it using:

``` bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

### 3\. Contribution Guidelines

You can contribute code to **three specific locations** within the project:

1. <b>`chapter_codes/`</b> – Contribute high-quality, well-documented code related to specific chapters.
2. <b>`students/your_username/`</b> – A personal folder where you can upload any reasonable code you want.
3. <b>`students/contributions/`</b> – Submit quality contributions that may benefit the entire class.

**Important Note:**

* Ensure that code in `chapter_codes/` and `students/contributions/` meets quality standards.
* Feel free to experiment and upload any relevant code in `students/your_username/`.

- - -

### 4\. Basic Workflow to Contribute Code

**Step 1: Create or Switch to a Working Branch**
Before making changes, create a new branch or switch to an existing branch you are working on:

* To create a new branch:

``` bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

* If you have an existing branch:

``` bash
git checkout existing-branch-name
```

- - -

**Step 2: Start Working on Your Changes**

* Modify the code or add new files in the appropriate folder (`chapter_codes/`, `students/your_username/`, or `students/contributions/`).
* Test your changes to ensure they work correctly.

- - -

**Step 3: Add Your Changes**
After making changes, add them to the staging area:

``` bash
git add .
```

- - -

**Step 4: Commit Your Changes**
Write meaningful commit messages following this format:

``` bash
git commit -m "Added [feature/bugfix] in [folder_name]: Short description"
```

**Examples:**

``` bash
git commit -m "Added quicksort algorithm in chapter_codes"
git commit -m "Fixed bug in students/contributions/matrix_operations"
```

- - -

**Step 5: Push Your Changes**
Push your local changes to the remote repository:

``` bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

- - -

**Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)**

1. After pushing, you will see a message with a link to create a pull request (PR). Note: If you are already working on old PR you don't need to create new PR.
2. Click on the link or manually go to the GitHub repository and create a PR.
3. **Specify:**
    * A meaningful title.
    * A brief description of your changes.
    * Select the correct branch for merging.

- - -

**Step 7: Request Code Review**

* Add reviewers by tagging:
    * Your **friend** and **Grader** (`@sandhyaneupane`) or **ME**(`@keshavsbhandari`).
* I may not always be available to review, but TA or your friends can provide feedback. Eventually TA will approve your PR and you can merge it to main.

- - -

**Step 8: Merge the Code**

* Once the PR is **approved**, you will have permission to merge your code.
* Click the "Merge" button to incorporate your changes into the main branch.

- - -

### 5\. Additional Tips

* **Sync Your Local Repo:**
Before starting new work, always fetch the latest changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

* **Check Your Work:**
Use `git status` to track changes and ensure everything is staged before committing.
* **Stay Organized:**
Work on small, manageable tasks instead of large, complex changes in a single PR.

Following these steps ensures a smooth contribution process and helps maintain project quality.

## GIT CHEAT SHEET

### GIT CLONING

Clone a repository from a remote URL:

``` bash
$ git clone https://git.somedomain.com/some.git
```

### CHECKING CURRENT BRANCH

Default branch is usually `main`. To check your current branch:

``` bash
$ git branch
```

### CREATING A NEW BRANCH

Create a new branch and switch to it immediately:

``` bash
$ git checkout -b branch_name
```

### SWITCHING BRANCHES

Switch to an existing branch:

``` bash
$ git checkout branch_name
```

### DELETING A BRANCH

You need to be on the `main` branch to delete another branch:

``` bash
$ git branch -d branch_name
```

### FORCE DELETE A BRANCH

If the branch contains changes that need to be discarded:

``` bash
$ git branch -D branch_name
```

### REVERTING CHANGES

Undo added changes before committing:

``` bash
$ git reset
```

Undo the last commit and move changes back to staging:

``` bash
$ git reset HEAD~
```

### ADDING FILES TO STAGING

Stage files for commit:

``` bash
$ git add path_to_things
```

**Examples for `path_to_things`:**

* Add all changes: `--all`
* Add a specific file: `some/folder/file.txt`
* Add all files in a folder: `some/folder/*`
* Add an entire folder: `some/folder`

### PUSHING CHANGES

Push changes to a remote repository:

``` bash
$ git push -u origin branch
```

### GURU MANTRA: ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH

Always pull the latest changes before making any modifications:

``` bash
$ git pull
```
